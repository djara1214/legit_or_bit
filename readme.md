## **Legit or Bit** 	

    is it legit or a bit?

Legit or Bit is a fact checking service bot that lives in Whats app. This bot is designed for those who have Meta subsided internet plans. These plans offer extra gibibytes or unlimited data for Meta products. It is unreasonable to expect people without easy and reliable internet access to be meticulous and thorough in verifying the veracity of the information they receive. So this tool offers those who have these plans a way to fact check websites and claims that may be shared to them or they may have themselves; without the risk of overages and charges on their phone plans.
We are powered by the Claim Busters Fact Checking API created by The University of Texas at Arlington. Which scores all user submissions. We also provide similar articles and information for article submissions which is done by contacting the Google Fact Explorer API.
